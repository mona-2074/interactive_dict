This Java project implements an interactive dictionary using a binary search tree data structure. Users can input an alphabet to retrieve words starting with that letter, and then select a word to view its definition. The program includes functionalities for inserting words and definitions, searching for words, and displaying suggestions if a word is not found. It's a simple yet practical application demonstrating basic data structure concepts and interactive user input in Java.

Limitations of the project :

Lacks GUI interface
Limited word search capabilities *(only 5 words for each alphabet).
